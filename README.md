# BERTAN
Turkish BERT model trained from scratch as an undergrad class project

I trained this model using the HugginFace Transformers and PyTorch Framework. 

The model trained on 4 RTX3090 GPU's for 10 days.

This repo also includes a finetuned version of BERTAN: Sentimental BERTAN, which is fintuned to classify Turkish text by sentiment.

You can use the checkpoints to acces the trained models or use the notebook to train them yourself.
