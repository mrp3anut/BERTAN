# BERTAN
Turkish BERT model trained from scratch as an undergrad class project

I trained this model using the HugginFace Transformers and PyTorch Framework. 

The model trained on 4 RTX3090 GPU's for 10 days.

The notebook also includes a finetuned version of BERTAN: SentimentBERTAN, which is fintuned to classify Turkish text by sentiment.

You can use the checkpoints for [BERTAN](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zMcKH1HFisuytYfA69tqm1KwJFH7NFGF) and [SentimentBERTAN](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wbWYlhrEAUC7iN4bcEUXLw1xjhimvjE-) to acces the trained models or use the notebook to train them yourself.
